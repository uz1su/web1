<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" title="html5 spicification">Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed[4] alcoholic drinks in the world,</a>
and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea.[5]
Beer is brewed from cereal grains—most
commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used.
During the brewing process,
fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in
the resulting beer.[6] Most modern beer is
brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural
preservative and stabilizing agent.
Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used
instead of hops.
In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during
processing and replaced
with forced carbonation.

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of
Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours,[8] and "The Hymn to Ninkasi",
a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in
a culture with few literate people.
Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught,
